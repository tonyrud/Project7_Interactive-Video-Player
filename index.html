              Now that we've looked at the architecture of the internet, let's see how you might connect your personal devices to the internet inside your house. Well there are many ways to connect to the internet, and most often people connect wirelessly.

              Let's look at an example of how
              you can connect to the internet.

              If you live in a city or a town,
              you probably have a coaxial cable for


              cable Internet, or a phone line if you
              have DSL, running to the outside of

              your house, that connects you to
              the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.

              If you live far out in the country,
              you'll more likely have

              a dish outside your house, connecting
              you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or


              you might also use the telephone system.


              Whether a wire comes straight from
              the ISP hookup outside your house, or


              it travels over radio
              waves from your roof,


              the first stop a wire will make once
              inside your house, is at your modem.


              A modem is what connects the internet
              to your network at home.

              A few common residential modems are DSL or
